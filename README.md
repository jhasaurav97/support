## About
This is a simple contact form built with PHP. It demonstrates basic server-side scripting and email functionality using the `mail()` function in PHP.

## Note
GitHub Pages does not support server-side scripting languages like PHP. As a result, this project cannot be hosted live on GitHub Pages. To test and run the project, you need to set up a local server environment.
